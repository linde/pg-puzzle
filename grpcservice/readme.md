TODO: this package could probably become two things:

* a generic RPC server helper package with grpcclient and grpcserver and associated tests
  * this should also include some repsective unit tests
  * might want to have an e2e test with a trivial rpc service
* the specific client for pgpuzzle and any tests for it
