# About
this is a a project based on a puzzle game i was given. the point is to test if the game has any configuration which is unsolvable.

<img src="doc/puzzle.jpg" width="400">

Currently, it can solve a set of stops (ie the 3 pieces you move around to make a puzzle) and also roll through and try all stops (here are the [solutions](doc/solutions.json)). This was generated by running: `go run main.go solve  --all  -o=json > doc/solutions.json`

# Get compile dependancies, as necessary


```bash
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.28
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.2
go install github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway@latest
```



# Build

```bash
$ go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer@latest
$ go generate ./...
$ go build

```

# Usage

```bash
$ go run main.go solve --help
solve for default pieces

Usage:
  pg-puzzle solve [flags]

Flags:
  -a, --all            try every stop combination, not allowed with --stops
  -h, --help           help for solve
  -s, --stops string   board stops to solve, '[0-4],[0-4] [0-4],[0-4] [0-4],[0-4]' (default "0,0 0,4 4,2")
  -v, --verbose        with --all, print the solutions
  -n, --workers int    number of workers for --all (default 8)
```

I used this as an excuse to learn features of golang, lots can be improved in the code and the code style.


# TODOs

* TODO change the name of some of the `solve.go` files all over
